# fup1

Productivity experiment on writing Tetris for multiple platforms using metaprogramming and conditional compilation. Implemented for both SDL and JS canvas (which the metaprogramming for was actually very simple).

Windows binaries in releases, browser version at https://metagn.github.io/fup1/browser.

No score system or comprehensive interface, no sophisticated T-spins, I and O piece rotations are different.
